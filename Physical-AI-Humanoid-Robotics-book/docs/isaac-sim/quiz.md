## Question 3
What is the primary purpose of synthetic data generation in robotics?

A) To reduce computational requirements
B) To provide training data for AI models when real data is scarce or expensive
C) To replace physical robots entirely
D) To simplify robot programming

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
B) To provide training data for AI models when real data is scarce or expensive

Synthetic data generation allows for creating large datasets for training AI models in a controlled environment, which can be more cost-effective and safer than collecting real-world data.

## Question 4
Which component in Isaac Sim manages the simulation state and physics engine?

A) Stage
B) World
C) Viewport
D) Prim

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
B) World

The World class in Isaac Sim manages the simulation state, physics engine integration, scene graph management, and time step control.
</details>

## Question 5
What is the main advantage of using simulation for robotics development?

A) It's always faster than real hardware
B) It allows for safe testing and rapid iteration without physical hardware constraints
C) It perfectly replicates real-world conditions
D) It requires no computational resources

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
B) It allows for safe testing and rapid iteration without physical hardware constraints

Simulation provides a safe environment to test algorithms, enables rapid iteration, and allows testing of edge cases that would be dangerous or impractical with physical hardware.
