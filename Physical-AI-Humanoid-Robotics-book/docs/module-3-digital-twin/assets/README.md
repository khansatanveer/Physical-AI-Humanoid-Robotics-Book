# Digital Twin Assets Directory

This directory contains diagrams, images, and other assets for the Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) module.

## Diagram Types Needed

### Physics Concepts
- Gravity force diagram showing acceleration over time
- Collision detection illustration showing collision vs. visual geometry
- Humanoid robot URDF joint structure
- Physics simulation loop timing diagram

### Unity Visualization
- Coordinate system alignment between Gazebo and Unity
- Real-time synchronization pipeline
- Performance optimization workflow

### Sensor Simulation
- LiDAR point cloud generation
- Depth camera projection model
- IMU orientation representation

## Asset Guidelines
- Use consistent color schemes and styling
- Maintain 72 DPI for web display
- Provide SVG versions when possible for scalability
- Include descriptive alt text for accessibility

## Current Assets
