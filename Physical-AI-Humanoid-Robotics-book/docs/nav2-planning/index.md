# Nav2 for Humanoid Path Planning

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:
1. Configure Navigation2 (Nav2) for humanoid robot navigation
2. Understand the differences between wheeled robot and humanoid robot navigation
3. Set up path planning algorithms suitable for humanoid kinematics
4. Configure Nav2 parameters for complex humanoid movement constraints
5. Implement obstacle avoidance and dynamic replanning for humanoid robots

## Overview

This chapter focuses on Navigation2 (Nav2), the state-of-the-art navigation framework for ROS 2, specifically configured for humanoid robots. Unlike traditional wheeled robots, humanoid robots have complex kinematic constraints that require specialized path planning approaches.

Nav2 provides a flexible, behavior-based navigation system that can be adapted for humanoid robots with their unique movement capabilities and constraints. You'll learn how to configure Nav2 for bipedal locomotion, step planning, and whole-body navigation.
