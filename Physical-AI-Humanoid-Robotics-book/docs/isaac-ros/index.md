# Isaac ROS Pipelines for VSLAM and Navigation

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:
1. Understand the integration between Isaac Sim and ROS for robotics applications
2. Set up and run Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) pipelines
3. Configure navigation systems using Isaac ROS components
4. Process sensor data through Isaac ROS message passing
5. Integrate perception and navigation systems for autonomous robot operation

## Overview

This chapter introduces Isaac ROS, NVIDIA's collection of robotic libraries and tools that connect Isaac Sim with the Robot Operating System (ROS). You'll learn how to leverage Isaac ROS packages for perception tasks like Visual SLAM and navigation tasks in simulated environments.

Isaac ROS bridges the gap between high-fidelity simulation in Isaac Sim and the powerful robotics framework of ROS, enabling efficient development and testing of robotic perception and navigation systems.
