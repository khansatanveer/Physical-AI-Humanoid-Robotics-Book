# Kinematics in Robotics

This is a placeholder file for the kinematics chapter in the fundamentals section.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Understand forward and inverse kinematics
- Apply kinematic principles to robotic systems
- Analyze the movement of robotic arms and legs

## Content Coming Soon

This section will cover the mathematical principles behind robotic movement, including:
- Forward kinematics: calculating end-effector position from joint angles
- Inverse kinematics: calculating joint angles from desired end-effector position
- Jacobian matrices and their applications
- Applications to humanoid robot locomotion and manipulation
